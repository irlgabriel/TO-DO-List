# This is part of [the odin project JS curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)


# [Current deployment](https://todo-project-cfa27.web.app)

# Issues :

  # (FIXED!) The code is a hot mess!

  # (FIXED!) I need to figure how to render the project(done!) and notes associated to them just with information from the database! 

  # (FIXED!) Create animations for left-nav bar and one animation for notes.
